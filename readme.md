# Spotify Stats Analyser
Allows the user to input spotify data files and get some graphs of listens over time, top artist songs

Made to re-learn Python, most code here is probably not great. If I was to redo this, I'd probably make it use some web-ui

NOTE: may not work on new spotify data files & does not accept endsong files.
